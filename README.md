# Kai-and-his-weapons

Technically, this is the first project I put on the Github. As I'm not quite familiar with the procedure, some mistakes may occure. <br>
At first, I just want to find out the best weapons for Kai, a Warrior in the moba game King-of-Glory. Since there are only a few choices, I simply list all the possibilities and analyze the damage. Meanwhile, the inscriptions are also considered.<br>
At present, this project only contains 3 weapons and 3 kinds of red inscriptions which means many variables are still not considered. <br>
This project is fundamental and might be extended to a general model to figure out the best choice in different periods. Maybe later I would like to improve it.
